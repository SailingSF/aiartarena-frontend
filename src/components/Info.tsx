            <h3 className="font-semibold">Q: What are the benefits to the <em>PREMIUM</em> Image Generator</h3>
            <p>A: Faster access to some of the best available models, both open and closed weights. Automatic "prompt engineering" to make your prompts more likely to create cool images.</p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold">Q: Why would I use an API key on the free image generator?</h3>
            <p>A: Using your own API key takes this app completely out of the loop. Your prompt and image won't be stored by this app and shown to all in the gallery page. My free version comes with rate limits that have to be shared by all users, using your own key means you will only be subject to the rate limiting of your own API key. Privacy is the big reason, rate limits are the other.</p>

            <h3 className="font-semibold">Q: What if I don't like your prompt engineering?</h3>
            <p>A: After creating an image in the <em>PREMIUM</em> Generator you will get the "enhanced prompt" we turned it into. This was done in accordance with prompt engineering guidelines for that prompt. You can edit and submit a subsequent prompt from this field and the prompt won't be touched. This prompt is final. If you are requesting an image from the Dall-e-3 model, OpenAI applies their own prompt engineering (and safety) that is <em>not</em> editable.</p>
