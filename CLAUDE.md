# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Stack

Create React App (react-scripts 5) + TypeScript 4.9 + React 18 + React Router v6 + Tailwind CSS. Package manager: npm. This is **not** Vite or Next.js — there is no SSR; all routing is client-side.

## Commands

- `npm start` — dev server
- `npm run build` — production build to `build/`; its `postbuild` step auto-runs `scripts/generate-sitemap.js` to emit `build/sitemap.xml` and `build/robots.txt`
- `npm run generate:sitemap` — run the sitemap/robots generator standalone
- `npm test` — Jest (watch mode by default; use `CI=true npm test` to run once, `npm test -- -t "name"` for a single test)
- `npm run format` — Prettier write across `src/`; `npm run format:check` to verify without writing

## Environment

Requires a local `.env` (gitignored) with:
- `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` — backend API endpoint, read across components
- `REACT_APP_SITE_PASSWORD` — optional site-access password
- `SITE_URL` (or `REACT_APP_SITE_URL`) — base URL for sitemap generation; defaults to `https://yourdomain.com` if unset
- `REACT_APP_SITE_URL` also builds the canonical URL in `src/App.tsx`, which falls back to `https://aiartarena.com`

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Routes** are lazy-loaded in `src/App.tsx` via `React.lazy` + `Suspense`. When adding a public route, also add its path to the `routes` array in `scripts/generate-sitemap.js` (lines ~8-15) or it won't appear in the sitemap.
- **SEO**: per-page `<title>`/meta use `react-helmet-async`; `HelmetProvider` wraps the app in `src/index.tsx`. The `<link rel="canonical">` is declared **once**, in `src/App.tsx`, from the current path — don't add per-page ones. Every page used to carry its own and they all pointed at `yourdomain.com`.
- Shared TypeScript interfaces live in `src/types.ts`.
- Auth is a **DRF token** in `localStorage` under `token`, sent as `Authorization: Token <key>` (not a JWT, despite the name). Activation happens via the `/activate/:token` route.
- **Auth state comes from `useAuth()`** (`src/AuthContext.tsx`), not from reading `localStorage` during render. `<AuthProvider>` wraps the app in `src/App.tsx` and owns the token, the live account, and the single `AuthModal`. Reading the token at render time is not reactive — logging in would leave the rest of the page believing the user was signed out until the next navigation. Use `login(token)` rather than writing `localStorage` yourself; that is what updates the navbar balance.
- **Billing and credits** have their own section below — read it before touching anything that displays a balance.
- **Analytics** live in `src/analytics.ts`: GA4 (ID hardcoded there) plus Meta Pixel, X Pixel and Microsoft Clarity, each loaded only if its env var is set (`REACT_APP_META_PIXEL_ID`, `REACT_APP_X_PIXEL_ID`, `REACT_APP_X_SIGNUP_EVENT_ID`, `REACT_APP_X_PURCHASE_EVENT_ID`, `REACT_APP_CLARITY_PROJECT_ID`). Report conversions with `track()`, which fans out to every loaded tag. Don't send GA page views from the router — enhanced measurement already does, and doing both double-counted every page.
- Formatting is Prettier (`.prettierrc.json`): single quotes, semicolons, 2-space indent, 100-col, `trailingComma: es5`. `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` auto-sorts Tailwind classes, so don't hand-order `className` strings. Correctness linting is CRA's built-in `react-app` ESLint, with `eslint-config-prettier` disabling formatting rules that conflict.

## Billing and credits

The backend sells credits through Stripe Checkout (hosted redirect). This app never
renders a card form and never sees card details — it hands off to Stripe and reads
the result back over the API.

### Never trust the localStorage balance

`AuthModal` stashes a `credits` value in `localStorage` at login. It is a **snapshot**
and goes stale the moment the user generates an image or buys a pack.

Use `useAuth()` (`src/AuthContext.tsx`), which reads
`GET /api/me/` through `<AuthProvider>`, and call `refresh()` after anything that
moves credits — a generation, a purchase. The provider keeps the `localStorage` copy
in step for older code still reading it, and drops the token on a 401 rather than
leaving a stale number on screen.

The balance is on screen in more than one place now — the navbar pill
(`src/components/AccountNav.tsx`), the `/billing` card, and the home hero — so a
generation that doesn't call `refresh()` leaves several stale numbers, not one.

The sentence that breaks the balance into its two buckets is rendered by both the
navbar and `/billing`, and it had already drifted out of step once (both were still
saying the monthly bucket "resets"). Both now read the labels from
`src/billingCopy.ts`; change the wording there, not in the components.

### Two buckets, different lifetimes

`GET /api/me/` returns `credits` (the spendable total) plus the two buckets behind
it. They are not interchangeable and the UI should not merge them silently:

- `monthly_credits` — subscription allowance, granted each billing period and **rolls
  over**; an unspent allowance is not taken back
- `purchased_credits` — from packs and the signup bonus, **never expires**

Spending drains the monthly bucket first.

### Routes

| Route | In sitemap | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/billing` | yes | catalog + balance; public, doubles as the pricing page |
| `/billing/success` | **no** | where Stripe returns after payment; `noindex` |
| `/billing/cancel` | **no** | where Stripe returns if the user backs out; `noindex` |

The two return pages are transactional and only meaningful with a `session_id`, so
they are deliberately kept out of `scripts/generate-sitemap.js`. Don't add them.

### The `/billing` wording lives in `src/billingCopy.ts`

Headings, benefit bullets, the two section pitches, the button labels and the
reassurance line are strings in `src/billingCopy.ts`, not inline JSX — the file exists
so the marketing copy can be edited without touching a component. It holds words only:
no prices, no credit amounts, no logic. The "Best value" badge picks its own pack from
the catalog's credits-per-dollar, so a backend reprice moves it without a frontend change.

### Prices are not ours to state

`/billing` renders the catalog from `GET /api/billing/products/`. Prices, credit
amounts, and product keys live in the backend's `billing/products.py` and **must not
be hardcoded here** — same contract as the model catalog. Checkout POSTs only a
`product_key`; the amount charged is resolved server-side, so repricing is a
backend-only change this app picks up on the next load.

Model costs shown in the generators follow the same rule — they come from
`GET /api/models/`. The Arena quotes the sum of its `arena_defaults` costs because
that is literally what `generate_arena_images` charges (it adds up the same
`APPROVED_MODELS` costs the `premium` list is built from). If a default ever stops
resolving in that list, `ArenaGenerator` quotes nothing rather than a wrong total.

### The webhook race

Stripe redirects to `/billing/success` the moment the card clears, but credits are
granted by a backend webhook that lands a beat later. Reading the balance once on
that page will sometimes show the **pre-purchase** number — which reads as a failed
payment to a user who was just charged.

`BillingSuccess` therefore polls `GET /api/billing/checkout-status/`, which reports
`paid` (Stripe has the money) and `fulfilled` (the backend applied it) as separate
facts, until `fulfilled`. After ~30s it falls back to "payment received, credits on
the way" rather than implying failure — at that point the money is definitely taken
and the webhook will still land.

Keep that distinction if you touch this page. Collapsing `paid` and `fulfilled` into
one boolean reintroduces the bug.

### Out of credits is not an auth problem

A 403 from a generator means "not enough credits or wrong tier". Report it inline
with `CreditNotice` next to the button that failed, and give it a link to `/billing`.
It used to be passed to `openAuthModal()`, which showed a **login form to a user who
was already logged in** and offered no way to buy anything. Reserve the auth modal
for people who are genuinely signed out.

### The signup bonus is mirrored, not fetched

`SIGNUP_BONUS_CREDITS` in `src/constants.ts` is the one place the new-account bonus
is written down, and it is quoted in the register form, the navbar, the home hero,
the signed-out generate buttons, the `/activate/:token` confirmation and `/billing`. The backend owns the real number; if
the API ever reports it, read it from there and delete the constant — the same
contract as prices and model costs.

### Local development gotcha

The backend builds Checkout return URLs from its own hardcoded `SITE_URL`
(`https://aiartarena.com`). Starting checkout from `localhost:3000` will therefore
redirect to the **production** site on completion, not back to your dev server.
Testing the success page locally requires pointing the backend's `SITE_URL` at
`http://localhost:3000`.

## Image editing (`/edit`)

`EditGenerator` posts to `POST /api/generate-image-with-input/`. Controls are gated on
the `supports_*` flags of the selected `catalog.edit` entry — the server rejects a
parameter the model can't use, so showing a control for a `false` flag produces a 400
the user can't act on.

### Send an id, not the bytes

"Edit this image" (`EditImageButton`, used by the gallery modal, the arena modal and
the premium result) passes the image's **id** through router state, and the editor
submits it as `source_image_id`. The server presigns the object it already holds.

Do not go back to fetching the image and re-uploading it. That is what this did
first, and it broke: fetching one of our own S3 objects from the browser depends on
the bucket's CORS allowlist covering the serving origin — `aiartarena.com` and
`localhost:3000` are on it, `www.` and preview hosts are not — and on the browser not
reusing the non-CORS cache entry the `<img>` tag just created for the same url. An id
has neither failure mode, and skips a 10 MB round trip.

`imageFiles.ts` keeps only the upload validation for files chosen from disk; the
extension is what the server reads to decide a file's type, not the MIME.

### 400 vs 502

400 means the request must change — no retry button. 502 means the provider failed and
**nothing was charged** (credits are deducted only after the image is stored), so it
gets one. A client-side timeout is neither: the server may still be finishing, so that
message tells the user to check their balance rather than promising a free retry.

Edits now land in the public gallery like any other image unless the request opted
out, and they carry their lineage with them: every gallery payload has `is_edit` and
`edit_source`. `edit_source.type` is `site_image` when the source was one of our own
pictures (the other keys then link back to it and describe how it was made) and
`user_upload` when it was a file the user brought, in which case every other key is
null and there is nothing to link to. `ImageModal` renders that provenance, so an
edit's `generation_log.prompt` is labelled as an instruction rather than as the prompt
that made the picture.

## Prompt improvement

`PremiumGenerator` has an "Improve" button that calls `POST /api/improve-prompt/`
(free, for accounts with at least 1 credit -- the button is hidden otherwise) and puts
the result in the editable improved-prompt box. Whatever is in that box is sent as
`improved_prompt` and used verbatim. The improvement is written for one model, so the
box warns when the selected model changes. The free generator deliberately has no such
step: free users only ever see an improved prompt returned with a finished image, so the
backend can't be used as a free text generator. Don't add one there.

## Git workflow

Branch off `main` for features and open a PR for review before merging — don't commit directly to `main`.
